# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, designed with a focus on accessibility and usability. The website is expected to meet **WCAG 2.0** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requirements, along with additional accessibility features to ensure an inclusive user experience.

## Pages

The website consists of the following pages:

- **Landing Page**: The landing page introduces visitors to the website with a brief description and several links to my social media profiles.
- **About Page**: This page provides a detailed explanation of my background, experience, and skills, helping potential employers or collaborators understand my journey and expertise.
- **Projects Page**: The projects page showcases the work I have done, highlighting key projects and demonstrating my technical abilities and creativity. I expect to continue to expand and stylize this page because of the lack of key projects.
- **Contact Page**: On the contact page, you'll find my email address and external links.

## Upcoming Pages

- **Colophon Page**: An upcoming addition that will provide technical details about the website's development, including the technologies used and any special design choices made.

## Conclusion

This portfolio website is an ongoing project. Through this website, I aim to demonstrate my commitment to accessible web design while showcasing my skills and experience in a clear and user-friendly manner.

Feel free to explore and contact me for any inquiries or collaborations!
